# Years to Days

A simple project that converts a user's age in years into the number of days they've lived. The interface includes input validation and dynamic responses based on user input.


## Features

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

3. Click the button to see the calculated result in days along with a message.

## How It Works

1. **Input Your Age**: Enter your age in the input field.
2. **Click the Button**: Press the button labeled "How many days have you lived?".
